INDIGEN Integration / Staging Repository
=================================================

Indigen (IDG) is the very first cryptocurrency and blockchain project designed specifically for the indigenous people. We hope to preserve indigenous cultures, products and works of art through an immutable storage of intellectual properties using blockchain technology.

Indigen is based on masternode concept using what we call SPEnD (Swift, Private, Energy-efficient, Decentralized) technology for low energy usage, super fast transaction confirmation; and PosS (Proof of shared Staking) protocol which gives fair opportunity for all our coin holders to earn portion of block rewards. 

Indigen was modeled after PIVX SwiftX technology, Zerocoin and Bitcoin Green protocols.

Our maximum supply is 17,000,000 IDG with block time of 60 seconds and block rewards of 17 IDG, halving every 1,700,000 blocks. The required collateral for masternodes is 17,000 IDG. 80% of block rewards are reserved for masternodes and 20% for stakers.
